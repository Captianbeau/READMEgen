# READMEgen
It can be hard to remember what all needs to go into a README, or a monotonous task. This generator is made to ease the struggle. It uses inquirer to get information, for the various categories of the README, from the user. Then It plugs that data into its code to generate a README with the correct Markdown format.

## Installation 

You can download the repository or probably just copy the code. (If itâ€™s purely for the generator function. No cheaters please!) This application requires node.js and inquirer to function.

## Usage

 This application is run in the console. It is recommended to have the appropriate information written and ready to copy into the prompts. In the console, in the README gen folder, type node index then follow the instructions. It will have the User type:
 - Their GitHub Username
 - Their Email
 - The title of their project
 - The license used (from a list)
 - The project description
 - The installation instructions
 - How to test
 
  It will then write a README file in the generator folder, where  the user can edit it to their preference then copy or move it to the proper place.
